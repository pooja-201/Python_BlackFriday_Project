## 🚀 Project Tasks
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and formatting data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Distribution of customers by gender, age group, and occupation.
  - Analysis of average purchase amounts.
  - Identification of top-selling product categories.
- **Visualization**:
  - `countplot` for gender and age distribution
